Question 1. 0.5 pts
What can you say about the timers for HAL and SysTick in a FreeRTOS System:
Group of answer choices

SysTick and HAL timers should be separate because they often require different interrupt priorities. (Correct)
HAL timers are always used by FreeRTOS for its internal tick count.
SysTick is only used for debugging and not for task scheduling in FreeRTOS.
HAL and SysTick timers are interchangeable and serve the same purpose in FreeRTOS.
FreeRTOS does not use any hardware timers; it relies entirely on software timing.

Group of answer choices

True (Correct)
False

Question 3. 0.5 pts
Tasks are able to suspend other tasks, just like the supervisor.
Group of answer choices

True
False (Correct)

Question 4. 0.5 pts
FreeRTOS is processor-independent, but is sometimes slightly customized to be able to match the feature and memory sizes of the hosting hardware.
Group of answer choices

True (Correct)
False

Question 5. 0.5 pts
"CMSIS" is just a standardized set of calls (APIs) that act as an abstraction so that RTOS code could be transported across various RTOS flavors, like FreeRTOS. Sometimes the terminology is slightly different. Match the CMSIS term (API Call) with the equivalent FreeRTOS.

Question 6. 0.5 pts
There are three things that need to be entered into the code (main.c) in order to add a task into a FreeRTOS system:

* The function prototype that defines what the callback looks like
* The code to add the callback into the FreeRTOS Running Queue
* The actual routine that does stuff
  Which of the following lines could be the function prototype?
  Group of answer choices

void vSensorTask(void pvParameters); (Correct)
xTaskCreate(vSensorTask, "Sensor", 100, NULL, 1, NULL);
void vSensorTask(void pvParameters) { /* task code */ }
vSensorTask();
TaskHandle_t xHandle;

Group of answer choices

True (Correct)
False

Question 8. 1 pt
FreeRTOS offers 5 different flavors of heap memory management. Heap 3 is optimized for:
Group of answer choices

Using the standard C library malloc() and free() functions (Correct)
Relies on the platform’s native heap management
Supports full dynamic allocation and deallocation
No internal memory management by FreeRTOS
Best when platform-provided allocators are preferred

A scheduler for managing threads and tasks in a real-time operating system
A configuration interface for defining memory protection zones and access levels
A set of neural network kernels optimized for embedded inference
A peripheral driver abstraction layer for UART, SPI, and I2C communication

Question 12. 1 pt
What do the CMSIS-SVD and CMSIS-DAP specifications cover?
Group of answer choices

CMSIS-SVD defines a standardized XML format for describing the system view of a device, including peripherals and registers, while CMSIS-DAP provides a standard debug interface for programming and debugging Arm Cortex-M devices. (Correct)
CMSIS-SVD defines a signal processing library for embedded systems, and CMSIS-DAP provides a real-time operating system interface for multitasking applications.
CMSIS-SVD is used to configure memory protection zones, and CMSIS-DAP is a neural network inference engine for embedded AI.
CMSIS-SVD describes GPIO pin configurations, and CMSIS-DAP is a driver abstraction layer for peripheral communication.
CMSIS-SVD is a startup code generator for Cortex-M devices, and CMSIS-DAP is a configuration tool for device memory mapping.
